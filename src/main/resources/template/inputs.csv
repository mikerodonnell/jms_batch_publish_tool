# delete these comments and put your comma-separated values, with a header row) in this file (and nothing else).
# the CSV values will correspond to the template file in this same directory.
#
# for example, if we have a template: 
#    <EVENT type="NEW">
#      <USERNAME>${username}</USERNAME>
#      <PASSWORD>${password}</PASSWORD>
#    </EVENT>
#   
#   then this file might look like this, which would result in 2 messages:
#    username,password
#    tjones,admin123
#    bsmith,jryan
